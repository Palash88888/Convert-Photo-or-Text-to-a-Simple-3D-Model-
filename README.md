# Convert-Photo-or-Text-to-a-Simple-3D-Model-
This prototype generates basic 3D models (.obj/.stl) from a single-object image or a short text prompt. It integrates AI/ML models for 3D generation, using image preprocessing or text-to-3D techniques to convert 2D input into printable 3D geometry. Outputs include downloadable files and 3D visualization.
# 🧱 Convert Photo or Text to a Simple 3D Model

This prototype generates basic 3D models (`.obj` or `.stl`) from either:
- A single-object **image** (e.g., a chair, toy, or car)
- A **text prompt** (e.g., “a small toy car”)

It demonstrates the use of AI/ML models for 3D object generation using image preprocessing and text-to-3D conversion.
