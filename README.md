# Convert-Photo-or-Text-to-a-Simple-3D-Model-
This prototype generates basic 3D models (.obj/.stl) from a single-object image or a short text prompt. It integrates AI/ML models for 3D generation, using image preprocessing or text-to-3D techniques to convert 2D input into printable 3D geometry. Outputs include downloadable files and 3D visualization.
